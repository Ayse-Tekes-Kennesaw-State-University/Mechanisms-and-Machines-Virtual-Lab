The virtual lab is developed for demonstration, position, velocity, and acceleration analysis of mechanisms and machines.

The Mechanisms and Machines virtual lab consists of the following submodules:
1. Finding the degree of freedom
2. Advanced Machine Dynamics: Single pendulum, double pendulum, link types, cart with pendulum, cart with double pendulum, cart with spring and double pendulum, eccentric cam, elliptical trammer, elliptical cam
3. Buckling and compression beams: various types of beam connections (pinned-pinned, fixed-free, fixed-fixed, fixed-guided,...)
4. Four-Bar linkages: Grashof and non-Grashof mechanisms
5. Pulley systems
6. Five Bar linkages
7. Straight line generators: Tchebicheff's staright line, Watts straight line, Quick return 1, and Quick return 2 mechanisms
8. Rotating unbalanced translational system
9. Beam Engine: Undamped and damped
